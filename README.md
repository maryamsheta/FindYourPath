### Important Note: We Couldn't Upload The Whole Unity Project, So We Uploaded The Scripts Only (The Folder That Contains All The Code)..

#### Two Modes Are In This Simulator/Game

## Watch Mode:

Consists of 3 Algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Bidirectional Search & Depth-First Search) where each one is set according to a theme. The player places the start, obstacles and end tiles where he wants on the tilemap and presses start AI then witnesses the path animation from the start to the end tile!

## Race Mode:

Consists of two tilemaps, one for each algorithm of the following (Breadth-First Search & Depth-First Search), we can start the AI after placing the tiles and see which one reaches the end tile first!
